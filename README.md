# RouteMap.jl

## What does it do?

Put geometric data and labels into a set of Legs. 

Create .svg and .bmp graphics showing legs in a birds-eye view. 

Labels are prioritized, and graphics are adapted primarily for A3 or A2 size.

Time is irrelevant to this package, unless you choose to scale geographical coordinates by travel time.

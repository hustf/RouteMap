# RouteMap.jl

## What does it do?

Put geometric data and labels into a set of Legs. Merge legs in a smart way when trying to add new but similar ones.

Effectively select legs from bounding boxes.

Create .svg and .bmp graphics showing legs in a birds-eye view. 

Labels are prioritized, and graphics are adapted primarily for A3 or A2 size.

Time is irrelevant to this package, unless you choose to scale geographical coordinates by travel time.
